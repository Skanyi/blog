      <description>1 FLag: I used netdiscover to identify the IP of the machine. 192.168.0.27
Accessed the IP on the browser
I then used dirb directory burster to find available directories. dirb http://192.168.0.27 I found one directory, tried to access it but had no permissions. The application suggested that there are several clues on the page. Started by checking the page source. Had an interesting script. Didn&amp;rsquo;t know what to do with it.</description>

      <description>Now back to the CTF:    Capturing the first flag: Capturing the 2nd flag: Captured the 3rd Flag:     Mr Robot ctf is created from the popular tv show.
This was my first attempt to do a CTF, and indeed it was not a walk in the park. Disclaimer, this might not be the efficient way to have solved the CTF and might have many repetitions or unnecessary steps, but it worked for me.</description>
